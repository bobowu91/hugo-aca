<p>I have experimented with a few exciting things that I always wanted to try.</p>
<p>To share with the world and also keep track of what I did. I am going to put them here. so this blog is first of all a note for myself and you might just find something interesting about it that you would like to keep in mind.</p>
<p>there will be a few sections for my blog</p>
<p>R - data wrangling with dplyr - plotting with ggplot2 - handling time with lubridate - handling string with stringr - base R function; apply family - R markdown =&gt; HTML and Presentation - hosting your R markdown HTML file online and start your blog today !! - how to use R with Github (version control)</p>
<p>Modelling with R - linear regression - logistic regression - survival analysis - association rules mining (basket analysis + FRM) - random number generation and simulation in R - markov chain analysis with R - social network analysis with R - k-means clustering with R and how to evaluate clusters</p>
<p>I want to learn:</p>
<p>H2O with R Ensemble approach with H20 Visualization</p>
<p>I learned but find out not so useful</p>
<p>Projects:</p>
<p>Python &amp; deep learning - time-series predication with LSTM in python</p>
<p>Optimization with excel solver</p>
